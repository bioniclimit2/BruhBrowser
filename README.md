# BruhBrowser 2.5

### What is BruhBrowser 2.5?

BruhBrowser 2.5 is a lightweight, resource-efficient web browser built just for fun by **bioniclimit2**. It’s simple, it’s clean, and it works (most of the time). Whether you’re on a gaming PC or a literal toaster, this browser has your back. Why? Because *¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯*.

*Fine print*: Yes, it’s **BruhBrowser 2.5**, not "Modern Bruh Browser." That name got stuck somewhere in the code, but who’s keeping track?

### Features

- **Custom Start Page**: A sleek and slightly ridiculous start page with "Bruh Search" for all your *bruh* moments.
- **Tabbed Browsing**: Open as many tabs as you want (your RAM might cry, though).
- **Navigation Buttons**: Back, Forward, Reload—everything a real browser has.
- **Lightweight Design**: No unnecessary nonsense, just browsing.
- **Made by bioniclimit2**, because why not?

### How to Install and Use?

1. **Download the Thing**:
   Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/bioniclimit2/BruhBrowser/releases) page and grab the latest ZIP file.

2. **Unzip It**:
   Extract the ZIP file to any folder you like. Desktop? Sure. Random folder you’ll forget later? Also fine.

3. **Run the `.exe OR .py`**:
   Double-click the `.exe OR .py` file and boom, you’re now running BruhBrowser 2.0.

4. Browse the web like a champ. Or a potato. Your choice.

### Why Did I Make This?

Honestly? Idk. I was bored, and building a browser seemed like a good idea at the time. So here it is. *¯\_(ツ)_/¯*. Made by **bioniclimit2**.
